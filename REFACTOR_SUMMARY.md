# Organization System Refactor Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored the organization membership system from a JSONB-based approach to proper relational tables using `organizations` and `org_members` tables.

## What Changed

### Database Schema

#### New Tables Created

1. **`organizations`** table
   - Separate entity for organizations (no longer stored in profiles)
   - Fields: `id`, `name`, `bio`, `avatar_url`, `is_verified`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
   - RLS policies for viewing and admin updates

2. **`org_members`** table
   - Join table for membership relationships
   - Fields: `org_id`, `member_id`, `role`, `created_at`
   - Roles: `member`, `admin`, `owner`
   - Composite primary key on `(org_id, member_id)`

#### Deprecated Fields (NOT dropped yet)

- `profiles.is_org` - Organizations now have their own table
- `profiles.organizations` - Membership now tracked in `org_members`

These fields are commented as deprecated but kept for safety. Drop them after verifying everything works.

### Updated RPC Functions

All organization-related functions updated to use new tables:

- `approve_org_request(req_id)` → Inserts into `org_members` table
- `reject_org_request(req_id)` → Checks `org_members` for authorization
- `revoke_org_membership(req_id)` → Deletes from `org_members` table

### New Helper Functions

- `is_org_admin(org_id, user_id?)` - Check if user is admin/owner
- `get_user_orgs(user_id?)` - Get all user's organizations with roles

### Frontend Updates

All portal pages updated:

#### `/src/app/portal/organizations/page.tsx`
- Dashboard now queries `organizations` table for org info
- Checks `org_members` to find user's admin orgs
- Displays org name from `organizations.name` instead of profile names

#### `/src/app/portal/organizations/members/page.tsx`
- Lists members from `org_members` table
- Shows member roles (owner/admin/member)
- Revoke function uses new table structure

#### `/src/app/portal/organizations/layout.tsx`
- Removed `is_org` checks
- Uses `org_members` to verify admin access
- Finds user's organizations via `org_members` query

#### `/src/app/portal/organizations/events/page.tsx`
- Updated to get org_id from `org_members`
- No longer relies on user profile being "the org"

#### `/src/app/portal/organizations/events/new/page.tsx`
- Creates events linked to org_id from `org_members`
- Ensures user is admin/owner before allowing event creation

#### `/src/app/portal/organizations/profile/page.tsx`
- Fetches from `organizations` table instead of profiles
- Updates `organizations` table for avatar changes
- Shows organization-specific fields

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Cleaner Data Model**: Organizations are separate entities, not special profile types
2. **Better Performance**: Indexed relational queries instead of JSONB array operations
3. **Role-Based Access**: Built-in role support (owner/admin/member)
4. **Easier Queries**: Standard SQL joins instead of JSONB containment operators
5. **Scalability**: Can add more org-specific fields without cluttering profiles
6. **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity

## Migration Strategy

The migration is designed to be **zero-downtime** and **safe**:

1. ✅ Creates new tables alongside existing fields
2. ✅ Migrates all existing data automatically
3. ✅ Updates all RPC functions
4. ✅ Frontend updated to use new structure
5. ⏳ Old fields kept as deprecated (manually drop when ready)

## Testing Checklist

Before dropping deprecated fields, verify:

- [ ] Organization dashboard loads correctly
- [ ] Membership requests work (approve/reject/revoke)
- [ ] Members list shows all members with correct roles
- [ ] Event creation works for org admins
- [ ] Profile updates save to organizations table
- [ ] Access control works (only admins can manage)
- [ ] Multi-org support works (if applicable)

## Files Modified

### Database
- ✅ `supabase/migrations/20251020_refactor_to_org_members.sql` - New migration
- ✅ `supabase/migrations/README.md` - Documentation

### Frontend
- ✅ `src/app/portal/organizations/page.tsx` - Dashboard
- ✅ `src/app/portal/organizations/layout.tsx` - Layout & access control
- ✅ `src/app/portal/organizations/members/page.tsx` - Members management
- ✅ `src/app/portal/organizations/events/page.tsx` - Events list
- ✅ `src/app/portal/organizations/events/new/page.tsx` - Event creation
- ✅ `src/app/portal/organizations/profile/page.tsx` - Org profile

## Next Steps

1. **Run the Migration**
   ```bash
   # Using Supabase CLI
   supabase db push
   
   # Or copy SQL to Supabase dashboard SQL editor
   ```

2. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Verify all functionality works
   - Check that existing orgs and members migrated correctly
   - Test with multiple organizations per user

3. **Drop Old Columns** (after confirming everything works)
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE public.profiles DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS is_org;
   ALTER TABLE public.profiles DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS organizations;
   ```

4. **Update Mobile App** (if applicable)
   - Update any mobile app code to query new tables
   - Update RPC calls to use new function signatures

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. Old columns still exist with data intact
2. Can revert RPC functions to old versions
3. Can update frontend to query old columns again
4. New tables can be dropped if needed

However, the migration preserves all data, so rollback should not be necessary.

## Questions?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that migration ran successfully
2. Verify RLS policies allow your queries
3. Check that user has proper role in `org_members`
4. Ensure `organizations` table has entries for your orgs
