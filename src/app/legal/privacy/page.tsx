      <p><strong>Welcome to Moments!</strong></p>
      <p>
        We built Moments to bring people together in real life, not to sell your data or flood you with
        noise. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we
        protect it.
      </p>
      <p>By using Moments, you agree to the collection and use of your information as described here.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>When you use Moments, we collect information in three main ways:</p>

      <h3>a. Information You Provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Info:</strong> Name, email, profile photo, bio.</li>
        <li><strong>Connections:</strong> Friend requests, bumps, and people you interact with.</li>
        <li><strong>Content:</strong> Posts, photos, messages, and other things you share.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>b. Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Device & App Info:</strong> Device type, operating system, app version, language.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> How you navigate the app, features you use, crashes or errors.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Location Info:</strong> Approximate location (city/area) if you enable it. We don’t share
          your exact GPS location with other users — Moments just uses broad location data to suggest
          connections nearby.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>c. Information from Others</h3>
      <p>
        If other users interact with you (e.g., send a bump, add you as a friend, tag you in a post), we
        collect that activity to make the app work.
      </p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and improve the Moments app and website.</li>
        <li>Suggest meaningful connections.</li>
        <li>Keep the community safe (detecting spam, abuse, or policy violations).</li>
        <li>Communicate with you (updates, support, service changes).</li>
        <li>Analyze trends to improve app features and reliability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We don’t sell your personal data to third parties.</p>

      <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
      <p>We may share your information only in the following cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>With Friends:</strong> Content you share is visible to the audience you select (friends or
          public).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>With Service Providers:</strong> Companies that help us run Moments (e.g., hosting,
          analytics, security) under strict data agreements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>For Safety and Legal Reasons:</strong> If required by law, to protect rights, prevent
          fraud, or ensure safety.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>With Your Consent:</strong> If you explicitly allow us to (e.g., letting us use your
          content for marketing).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. How We Protect Your Data</h2>
      <p>
        We use encryption, secure servers, and limited access policies to keep your data safe. No system
        is 100% secure, but we work hard to protect your information.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Your Choices and Controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access & Update:</strong> Update your account info anytime in the app settings.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Delete Account:</strong> Delete your account anytime; this removes your profile and most
          associated data. Some data (like logs required for safety or legal reasons) may be kept for a
          limited period.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Permissions:</strong> Control whether to enable features like notifications, camera,
          microphone, or location.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Moments is not for children under 13. If you’re under the age of consent in your country, you may
        need parental or guardian approval to use the app.
      </p>

      <h2>7. International Users</h2>
      <p>
        Your information may be transferred to servers outside your country. By using Moments, you consent
        to this transfer in line with applicable laws.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are significant, we’ll notify you in
        the app or by email 30 days before they take effect.
      </p>
