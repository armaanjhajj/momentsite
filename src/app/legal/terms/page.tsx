      <p><strong>Welcome to Moments!</strong></p>
      <p>
        We’re building a platform that helps you connect in real life, rewind missed connections, and
        spark spontaneous interactions. Our mission is to make digital tools that bring people together
        face-to-face, not keep them apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        To keep this space safe and clear, these Terms of Service (“Terms”), along with our Privacy
        Policy and Community Guidelines (together, the “User Agreement”), explain what you can expect
        from us, what we expect from you, and how we can all work together to make Moments meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using Moments you agree to these Terms. If you don’t agree, you can stop using our Services
        anytime.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Who Can Use Our Services</h2>
      <p>
        Our Services include the Moments mobile application, website, and related software, systems, and
        technology.
      </p>
      <p>To use Moments, you must be a real human being:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At least 13 years old. If you are under the age of consent where you live, you may also need
          parental or guardian consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Legally allowed to create an account for yourself or on behalf of an organization, company, or
          entity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        References to “you” mean you personally, or if you’re creating an account on behalf of someone
        else, the authorized person or entity.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Privacy and Data</h2>
      <p>
        Our <a href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect, use, and protect the
        information you share when you use Moments. By using our Services, you consent to the collection,
        storage, processing, and transfer of your information to partners and services that help us
        provide Moments.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Content</h2>
      <p>
        On Moments, content means profile photos, bios, posts, “bumps,” messages, and any media you
        share.
      </p>
      <p>You are responsible for the content you share. That means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Don’t share anything you don’t have the right to.</li>
        <li>Don’t share anything illegal, harmful, harassing, hateful, or exploitative.</li>
        <li>Do keep things authentic, respectful, and human.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You own the content you create. By posting it, you grant Moments a license to display,
        distribute, and use it for the purpose of operating and improving our Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Private Content:</strong> If you share content only with friends, we won’t use it for
        marketing unless you give us explicit permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Public Content:</strong> If you share something publicly on Moments, you grant us a
        worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, adapt, distribute, and promote that content across
        media formats as part of improving or promoting Moments.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Reporting Issues</h2>
      <p>
        We want Moments to feel safe. If you see content or behavior that violates these Terms or our
        Community Guidelines, you can report it through the in-app tools or via our website.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe your intellectual property is being infringed, you can file a report through the
        app or our IP reporting form.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Ending or Suspending Use</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate accounts that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Share harmful or illegal content.</li>
        <li>Harass or exploit others.</li>
        <li>Violate these Terms or our Community Guidelines.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We generally use a three-strike policy, but certain content (like child exploitation) will
        result in immediate and permanent suspension.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may also delete your account anytime through the app’s settings. Accounts inactive for 2+
        years may be deleted after advance notice.
      </p>

      <h2>6. License to Use Moments</h2>
      <p>
        We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use Moments while following
        these Terms. All rights to the Moments brand, software, trademarks, and related intellectual
        property remain ours.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        By using Moments, you agree that our liability (including affiliates, employees, and partners)
        is limited to the maximum extent allowed under the law of your country.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Applicable Law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the State of New Jersey, unless
        the laws where you live require otherwise. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of New
        Jersey.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make significant changes, we’ll notify you at
        least 30 days before they take effect. If you continue to use Moments after that, you’re agreeing
        to the updated Terms.
