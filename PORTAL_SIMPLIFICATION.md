# Portal Simplification - Complete

## Overview

The organization portal has been refocused to handle **only** the essential functions an organization needs to manage their community. All unnecessary features have been removed.

## What the Portal Does Now

### ‚úÖ Core Functions (KEPT)

1. **Dashboard** - View metrics & stats
   - Total events created
   - Total RSVPs received
   - Unique attendees count
   - Feedback reactions
   - Upcoming events display
   - Recent feedback posts

2. **Membership Management**
   - ‚úÖ Approve/deny membership requests
   - ‚úÖ **NEW: Promote members to admin** (owner-only)
   - ‚úÖ **NEW: Demote admins to member** (owner-only)
   - ‚úÖ Remove members from organization
   - Role badges (Owner üëë, Admin ‚≠ê, Member)
   - Clear role hierarchy display

3. **Profile Management**
   - ‚úÖ Edit organization name
   - ‚úÖ Edit organization bio/description
   - ‚úÖ Update organization avatar
   - Character counter for bio
