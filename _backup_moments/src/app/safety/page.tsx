      <p>
        At Moments, our mission is to spark real-life connections. With that comes a responsibility:
        keeping our community safe, both online and offline. This Safety Policy explains the standards we
        set, the tools we provide, and how we handle safety concerns.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Our Commitment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain clear rules against harmful, illegal, or abusive behavior.</li>
        <li>Provide tools for you to control your experience.</li>
        <li>Respond quickly to reports of unsafe behavior or content.</li>
        <li>Collaborate with trusted safety experts when necessary.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Safety Expectations for Everyone</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Respect boundaries:</strong> Only connect if both people want to. No harassment,
          intimidation, or stalking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be authentic, not deceptive:</strong> Don’t impersonate others, spread misinformation, or
          catfish.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No harmful content:</strong> We strictly prohibit hate speech, threats, sexual
          exploitation, child endangerment, and promotion of self-harm.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Report issues:</strong> If you see something unsafe, use the in-app reporting tools.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Breaking these rules can result in warnings, suspension, or permanent removal from Moments.</p>

      <h2>3. Tools for Your Safety</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Blocking & Reporting:</strong> Instantly block and report users who make you feel unsafe.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Privacy Controls:</strong> Choose whether your profile and posts are visible to friends,
          your network, or everyone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Location Protections:</strong> Moments never shares your exact GPS coordinates with other
          users. Location-based features only suggest general areas (like “near campus”).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content Moderation:</strong> Automated systems and human review help detect and remove
          harmful or illegal content.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Offline Safety</h2>
      <p>Because Moments encourages in-person connections, we ask you to follow best practices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Always meet in public spaces first.</li>
        <li>Let a friend know where you’re going.</li>
        <li>Trust your instincts — if something feels off, leave.</li>
        <li>Use the app’s tools (block/report) if someone behaves inappropriately.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Moments does not conduct criminal background checks on users, but we do enforce strict safety
        standards within the app.
      </p>

      <h2>5. How We Respond to Safety Issues</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Review & Action:</strong> We investigate reports and may remove content, issue warnings,
          suspend, or permanently ban accounts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Emergency Situations:</strong> If there is an imminent threat of harm, we may notify law
          enforcement as required by law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Repeat Violations:</strong> Our “three-strike” policy applies in most cases, but some
          violations result in immediate permanent bans.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Resources</h2>
      <p>If you or someone you know is in crisis, please seek help immediately:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the U.S., call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.</li>
        <li>If you’re outside the U.S., please reach out to your local emergency or crisis hotline.</li>
      </ul>
