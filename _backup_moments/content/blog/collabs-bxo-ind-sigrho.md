**Building Moments Together: Our Collabs with BXO, IND, and SigRho**

At Moments, we've always believed that the best connections don't just happen online — they happen when people come together, in real life, in ways that feel unforgettable. Over the past few weeks, we had the chance to prove that in the most electric way possible: by throwing some of the biggest, boldest, and most community-driven parties on campus with our friends at BXO, IND, and SigRho.

## The Energy of Collaboration

Each collab wasn't just about turning up the music — it was about creating a vibe where people could let loose, meet someone new, and maybe even spark a connection they didn't see coming. With BXO, the night was all about high energy and pure campus unity. With IND, it was creative chaos — the kind of party where every room buzzed with different conversations and opportunities. And with SigRho, we closed the loop with a perfect balance of fun, flow, and fire.

## Networking, but Not in the Boring Way

Sure, you can swap LinkedIns in class or exchange socials at a meeting, but there's something different about networking at a party. Between the music and the laughter, we saw people connecting across orgs, majors, and even campuses. Moments is about killing missed connections — and these collab parties gave people the perfect excuse to stop being strangers.

## Why It Matters for Moments

> These events are more than just good memories; they're proof of concept. Moments isn't just an app — it's a movement.

Every time someone meets a new friend, a project partner, or even just gets that spark of "yo, we should hang out again," we're doing exactly what Moments is meant to do.

## What's Next

We're just getting started. The collaborations with BXO, IND, and SigRho set the tone for how we want to build: loud, bold, and always rooted in real connections. Expect more collabs, more stunts, and more ways to make sure no connection is ever missed again.

Until then, shoutout to everyone who came through, danced, laughed, and left with new people in their circle. You're not just party-goers — you're the foundation of this whole thing. Let's keep building Moments.
